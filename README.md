# attribute_recognition
The project aims to improve facial attribiute recognition by parsing faces into the regions where attributes occur. We start with the CelebA dataset and add additional labels of facial landmarks and segment regions. This weakly labeled data is used as input into a Convolutional Neural Network which learns both the tasks of attribute prediction and segmentation.
